  workaround for what seems to be a vxWorks bug in watchdogs on PPC
   - bug description: In rare cases, watchdogs with timeout of a few
     ticks never trigger. wdStart had returned OK and wdShow says the
     whatchdog has timed out, but the callbback function has never
     been called.
     This has been observed on Motorola MVME2306 boards with the mv2304 BSP
     but not on Force FRC30 or FRC60.
   - effect: The bug effects all watchdogs, but is most obvious in the 'wait'
     protocol command. The record hangs forevever, STAT switches to
     SCAN_ALARM and all other records connected to the same device are
     blocked and receive lock timeouts forever.
   - The workaround helps but can NOT ensure 100% functionality.
